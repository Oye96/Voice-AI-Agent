## Problems

1. Overwhelmed Front Desk or Customer Service Teams  
   Restaurants often receive repetitive calls and messages asking about reservations, orders, or operating hours, leading to staff burnout.

2. Manual Reservation Confirmations  
   Staff must manually check spreadsheets, confirm bookings, and respond to customers, causing delays and errors.

3. No Voice Automation for Real-Time Data  
   Most voice bots cannot dynamically pull reservation or order data stored in platforms like Google Sheets.

4. Limited Language or Accessibility Support  
   Traditional restaurant bots offer limited multi-language voice interaction, which excludes regional or non-English-speaking customers.

5. Scalability Challenges for Multi-Branch Restaurants  
   Expanding support to multiple locations requires rebuilding workflows and retraining staff‚Äîadding cost and complexity.

6. Lack of Emotional Engagement  
   Text-based bots feel cold and robotic; customers prefer a warm, friendly human-like interaction.

## ‚úÖ Solutions

1. Automated Voice Response System  
   Using ElevenLabs, the agent speaks fluently and emotionally confirming reservations, orders, and menu info without staff intervention.

2. Google Sheets Integration for Real-Time Data Access  
   The n8n workflow reads live booking or order information directly from Sheets and converts it into accurate spoken replies.

3. Multilingual Voice Support  
   The built-in language detection module switches the response to the customer‚Äôs preferred language automatically.

4. Modular Workflow via n8n  
   Each restaurant branch can clone the same flow, link it to its own Sheets, and activate voice service without extra coding.

5. Emotion-Rich Speech for Better UX  
   ElevenLabs allows for voice customization, friendly, formal, enthusiastic‚Äîmaking customer interaction feel personalized.

6. Scalable, Low-Code Automation  
   Thanks to n8n, this project is extendable, low-code, and cost-effective to maintain and deploy.
